# Project_Demo

This project is a simple game powered by SFML, I'm developing it from 2-3 months;

This simple project served as a test of my current skills, currently this project is a little bit of an undeveloped and poorly documented mess that I'm trying to improve in spare moments;

# Compile

It can be compiled by typing this line:
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall  main.cpp src/*.cpp src/graphic/*.cpp src/input/*.cpp src/controllers/*.cpp src/abilities/*.cpp src/effects/*.cpp src/battles/*.cpp -o Demo -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system 

SFML is only dependency;

# Controls

Everything in game can be controlled by mouse, press Esc to quit game;
